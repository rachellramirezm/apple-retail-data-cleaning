Retail sale of Apple products through physical stores, with additional services such as extended warranties.

Available data assets:

- Products: product catalog
- Category: product classification
- Sales: sales transactions
- Stores: store information
- Warranty: warranty sales and usage

Business Context & Objectives
Apple Retail operates multiple physical stores with high sales volumes but lacks clear visibility into which products, categories, and stores generate the most economic value, as well as the real contribution of extended warranties to total revenue. This limitation hinders effective decision-making related to inventory management, promotions, and store performance optimization.

The objective of this project is to analyze Apple Retail’s sales performance at the product, category, and store levels, and to assess the economic impact of warranties. The analysis aims to identify profitability drivers, compare store performance, and uncover relevant sales patterns that support data-driven strategic decisions.

Key business questions addressed include identifying the most profitable products and categories, evaluating comparative store performance, and quantifying the contribution of warranties to overall revenue.

Key Metrics
- Total revenue
- Number of sales and average ticket
- Revenue by product and category
- Warranty revenue and warranty attachment rate
- Scope & Success Criteria

The project focuses on historical sales analysis, comparison across products, categories, and stores, and descriptive analysis of warranty performance. Success is defined by the ability to deliver a clean, validated, and well-structured dataset that enables reliable analysis and produces actionable insights clearly communicated to stakeholders.
