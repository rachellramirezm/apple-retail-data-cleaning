## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **data cleaning and transformation** for a retail sales dataset that presented multiple **data quality challenges**, including duplicated records and broken referential relationships between stores and sales data.

The main objective was to deliver a **clean, consistent, and analysis-ready dataset**, using **Excel for rapid exploration** and **SQL as the core transformation tool**, applying **CTEs, window functions, and JOIN operations**.

## 🧩 Data Quality Challenges

- Duplicate records in stores table  
- Inconsistent foreign keys affecting relational integrity  
 

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- 📊 **Excel**  
  - Rapid data exploration  
  - Initial validation and anomaly detection  

- 🧮 **SQL**  
  - Data cleaning and transformation  
  - CTEs (Common Table Expressions)  
  - Window functions for deduplication  
  - JOINs to restore relational consistency  

---

## 🔄 Cleaning & Transformation Workflow

1. Exploratory analysis in Excel to detect inconsistencies  
2. Identification of duplicated records across related tables  
3. Use of **window functions** to flag and resolve duplications  
4. Application of **JOINs** to rebuild and validate relational integrity  
5. Generation of clean, standardized tables ready for analysis
